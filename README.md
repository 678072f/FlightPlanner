# Flight Planner Application:

This application is a flight planner built for use with Microsoft Flight 
Simulator (MSFS), Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), X-Plane 11/12 
(XP11/XP12), and Prepar3D (P3D). 

This software is not specific to any of the above software, however, it is 
NOT intended for use for real world flight. This software is based on 
approximations of real data for fuel planning and performance purposes and 
is not sufficient for real flight.

This application is designed for use on iOS and macOS at the moment and is 
under development.
